### About myself
I am a second year student of BSU. I study at the faculty of Applied Mathematics. My goal is to become a good specialist and I will do my best for this. I am a very goal oriented person. I chose the front-end direction, because it seems to me very interesting, to do something and immediately see the result is cool.
